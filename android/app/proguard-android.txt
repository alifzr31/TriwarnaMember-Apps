# Add project-specific ProGuard rules here.
# By default, the flags in this file are appended to flags specified
# in C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\tools\proguard\proguard-android.txt
# You can edit the include path and order by changing the ProGuard
# configuration in build.gradle.
#
# For more details, see
#   http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/proguard.html

# Specify the maximum memory allocation pool for the VM, if running on a
# memory-constrained system.
#-Xmx384m

# Optimization is turned off by default. Dex does not like code run
# through the ProGuard optimize and preverify steps (and performs some
# of these optimizations on its own).
#-dontoptimize
#-dontpreverify

# If you want to enable optimization, you should include the
# following:
#-optimizations !code/simplification/arithmetic,!code/simplification/variable
#-optimizationpasses 5
#-allowaccessmodification
#
# Note that you cannot just include these flags in your own
# configuration file; if you are including this file, optimization
# will be turned off. You can redefine any of these settings in a
# configuration file of your own.

#-optimizations !class/marking/final

# The support library contains references to newer platform versions.

# Add any project specific keep options here:

# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following
# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface
# class:
#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {
#   public *;
#}

# Uncomment this to preserve the line number information for
# debugging stack traces.

# If you keep the line number information, uncomment this to
# hide the original source file name.
